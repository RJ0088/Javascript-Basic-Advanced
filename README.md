======================= Episode Number 2 =======================

## Episode - 2 (Code Editor)

### [2. What is a code editor?](https://youtu.be/8RCRqfUdLvI)

#### 1.1 What is a code editor?

- The code editor is kind of a writing board or ledger.
- Which is help us write anything.

#### 1.2 How much code editor have...?

- Usually, the code editor is only 2 types.

1. IDE
   > IDE stand for **Integrated Development Environment**
   > The below section includes some most popular IDE. For example:
   >
   > - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) -> `remember, it's not a Visual Studio code` it's a Visual Studio
   > - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) -> Basically, `Xcode is for only macOS`
   > - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) -> We know it's a very popular IDE
   > - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Lightweight Code editor
   > - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -> One of the best code editor for every developer.
   > - [Atom](https://atom.en.softonic.com/)
   > - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
   > - [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
   > - [Nodepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

#### 1.3 Why we won't use Visual Studio Code or VS code

- Firstly, it's our learning time.
- For the learning purpose we have to understand everything from empty.
- `For example:` we don't know what is the English latter and how to make a word so, how can we write a `sentence`? How
- I know you haven't any answer to this question.
- However, at that moment we are going to learn and I hope you have enough time to understand everything step by step very well.
- So, don't worry about that. We will do no such thing which is throwing bad issues to the learning point. `REMEMBER IT`.
- For this purpose, we will use [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). For the download sublime then just [click me](https://www.sublimetext.com/download_thanks?target=win-x64).
- After that, just install it with my video instruction
- [Click me for the watch installation process](https://youtu.be/8RCRqfUdLvI).

======================= Open JavaScript in console/alert =======================
======================= Episode Number 3 =======================
-->

## Episode - 3 (How to run JavaScript in browser console)

### [3. Run JavaScript in Console](https://youtu.be/b59h_KhWoIQ?list=PLdcGGiDG9Q0h4-g7UmW58c4-rki6aRleq)

#### 3.1 What are the `developer tools`?

- Developer tools are just a tool for seeing the output, and errors.
- Developer tool can help to debug our code.
- It's very useful for any programmer. We can do everything with developer tools.
  > `Note:` Actually we are a human we make a mistake it's a simple issue but if we make any mistakes then where we will check out our mistakes? Where? Let me tell you, we can check out mistakes in our developer tool. Alright?

#### 3.2 Where we can see our JavaScript error? And aslo where we can seen our output?

- Mainly, we can see our JavaScript output in the browser and our developer `console`.
- In the [video](https://youtu.be/b59h_KhWoIQ?list=PLdcGGiDG9Q0h4-g7UmW58c4-rki6aRleq) section I have already shown you we can see the output in `alert` and `console`.
- In the down below have 2 examples to see our javascript output.

```js
alert("Hello JavaScript!");
console.log("Hello JavaScript from the developer console.");
```

======================= What is JavaScript `Hello world program` =======================
======================= Episode Number 4 =======================
-->

## Episode - 4 (What is JavaScript `Hello world program`)

### [4. JavaScript Hello World program](https://youtu.be/WVDq7Gz0Lc4?list=PLdcGGiDG9Q0h4-g7UmW58c4-rki6aRleq)

#### 4.1 How we can see output in JavaScript?

- We can see our JS output in many ways.
- We can see our expected output in `console`.
- Also we can see our output in an `HTML document`.
- In the video section I have already shown you how to get output from the JS.
  > In the below section, a simple example

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript class - 4</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello javascript</h1>
    <script>
      alert("Hello JavaScript");
      console.log("Hello JavaScript");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

#### 4.2 What is **JavaScript**: `Hello World` program?

- We know sometimes our friend or teacher says to us, can you tell me what is the [Python](https://www.python.org/) `Hello world` program? Or what is [C](https://devdocs.io/c/) `Hello world` program? Am I right? Yeah, I know I'm right.
- For example here in the below section have [Python](https://www.python.org) `Hello World` program.

```python
# This program prints Hello, world!
print('Hello, world!')
```

- And here have [C] `Hello World` program for just a knowledge.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation ""-> "" call quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

##### Here is our targeted JavaScript Hello world Program.

> If we are using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) then we can see our Hello world message in anywhere `any where is means browser or terminal` both.

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

> However, this tutorial source code have in the `JavaScript Hello World Program` directory.
