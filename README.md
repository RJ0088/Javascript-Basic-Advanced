#### 3.1 What are the `developer tools`?

- Developer tools are just a tool for seeing the output, and errors.
- Developer tool can help to debug our code.
- It's very useful for any programmer. We can do everything with developer tools.
  > `Note:` Actually we are a human we make a mistake it's a simple issue but if we make any mistakes then where we will check out our mistakes? Where? Let me tell you, we can check out mistakes in our developer tool. Alright?

#### 3.2 Where we can see our JavaScript error? And aslo where we can seen our output?

- Mainly, we can see our JavaScript output in the browser and our developer `console`.
- In the [video](https://youtu.be/b59h_KhWoIQ?list=PLdcGGiDG9Q0h4-g7UmW58c4-rki6aRleq) section I have already shown you we can see the output in `alert` and `console`.
- In the down below have 2 examples to see our javascript output.

```js
alert("Hello JavaScript!");
console.log("Hello JavaScript from the developer console.");
```

## Episode - 4 (What is JavaScript `Hello world program`)

### [4. JavaScript Hello World program](https://youtu.be/WVDq7Gz0Lc4?list=PLdcGGiDG9Q0h4-g7UmW58c4-rki6aRleq)

#### 4.1 How we can see output in JavaScript?

- We can see our JS output in many ways.
- We can see our expected output in `console`.
- Also we can see our output in an `HTML document`.
- In the video section I have already shown you how to get output from the JS.
  > In the below section, a simple example

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript class - 4</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello javascript</h1>
    <script>
      alert("Hello JavaScript");
      console.log("Hello JavaScript");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

#### 4.2 What is **JavaScript**: `Hello World` program?

- We know sometimes our friend or teacher says to us, can you tell me what is the [Python](https://www.python.org/) `Hello world` program? Or what is [C](https://devdocs.io/c/) `Hello world` program? Am I right? Yeah, I know I'm right.
- For example here in the below section have [Python](https://www.python.org) `Hello World` program.

```python
# This program prints Hello, world!
print('Hello, world!')
```

- And here have [C] `Hello World` program for just a knowledge.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation ""-> "" call quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

##### Here is our targeted JavaScript Hello world Program.

> If we are using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) then we can see our Hello world message in anywhere `any where is means browser or terminal` both.

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

> However, this tutorial source code have in the `JavaScript Hello World Program` directory.
