### [4. JavaScript Hello World program](https://youtu.be/WVDq7Gz0Lc4?list=PLdcGGiDG9Q0h4-g7UmW58c4-rki6aRleq)

#### 4.1 How we can see output in JavaScript?

- We can see our JS output in many ways.
- We can see our expected output in `console`.
- Also we can see our output in an `HTML document`.
- In the video section I have already shown you how to get output from the JS.
  > In the below section, a simple example

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript class - 4</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello javascript</h1>
    <script>
      alert("Hello JavaScript");
      console.log("Hello JavaScript");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```

#### 4.2 What is **JavaScript**: `Hello World` program?

- We know sometimes our friend or teacher says to us, can you tell me what is the [Python](https://www.python.org/) `Hello world` program? Or what is [C](https://devdocs.io/c/) `Hello world` program? Am I right? Yeah, I know I'm right.
- For example here in the below section have [Python](https://www.python.org) `Hello World` program.

```python
# This program prints Hello, world!
print('Hello, world!')
```

- And here have [C] `Hello World` program for just a knowledge.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation ""-> "" call quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

##### Here is our targeted JavaScript Hello world Program.

> If we are using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs) then we can see our Hello world message in anywhere `any where is means browser or terminal` both.

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

> However, this tutorial source code have in the `JavaScript Hello World Program` directory.
