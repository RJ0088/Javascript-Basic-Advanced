#### 1.3 Why we won't use Visual Studio Code or VS code

- Firstly, it's our learning time.
- For the learning purpose we have to understand everything from empty.
- `For example:` we don't know what is the English latter and how to make a word so, how can we write a `sentence`? How
- I know you haven't any answer to this question.
- However, at that moment we are going to learn and I hope you have enough time to understand everything step by step very well.
- So, don't worry about that. We will do no such thing which is throwing bad issues to the learning point. `REMEMBER IT`.
- For this purpose, we will use [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). For the download sublime then just [click me](https://www.sublimetext.com/download_thanks?target=win-x64).
